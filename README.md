### About Me

- I'm the creator of **Jam**, a beginner-friendly programming language inspired by natural language
- I built a full **virtual physics lab** with data visualization and interactive simulations in JavaScript
- Created my own AI **assistant** (like Jarvis) using Python, speech recognition, and NLP
- Designed a chatbot that speaks my language — literally
- Working on a **fitness platform** with Google Sign-In, ReCAPTCHA, and more
- Also building an **e-commerce website** from scratch

> I don’t just follow tutorials — I **learn by building**, then revisit and **master the concepts** in depth.
